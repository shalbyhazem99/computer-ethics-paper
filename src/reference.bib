	abstract = {The proliferation of wearable devices, e.g., smartwatches and activity trackers, with embedded sensors has already shown its great potential on monitoring and inferring human daily activities. This paper reveals a serious security breach of wearable devices in the context of divulging secret information (i.e., key entries) while people accessing key-based security systems. Existing methods of obtaining such secret information relies on installations of dedicated hardware (e.g., video camera or fake keypad), or training with labeled data from body sensors, which restrict use cases in practical adversary scenarios. In this work, we show that a wearable device can be exploited to discriminate mm-level distances and directions of the user's fine-grained hand movements, which enable attackers to reproduce the trajectories of the user's hand and further to recover the secret key entries. In particular, our system confirms the possibility of using embedded sensors in wearable devices, i.e., accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, to derive the moving distance of the user's hand between consecutive key entries regardless of the pose of the hand. Our Backward PIN-Sequence Inference algorithm exploits the inherent physical constraints between key entries to infer the complete user key entry sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted with over 5000 key entry traces collected from 20 adults for key-based security systems (i.e. ATM keypads and regular keyboards) through testing on different kinds of wearables. Results demonstrate that such a technique can achieve 80\% accuracy with only one try and more than 90\% accuracy with three tries, which to our knowledge, is the first technique that reveals personal PINs leveraging wearable devices without the need for labeled training data and contextual information.},

The wearables include smart watches, smart bands, smart glasses and so on. The big data and data analysis can provide more benefits for users and companies. As for users, smart wearables can help to provide a more convenient and healthier lifestyle. Besides, the big data can provide more support for decision making of companies and may encourage creativity. However, ethical problems also appear with the development of smart wearables. First, vulnerabilities of system can be found, which may pose potential threat to users. Second, misused data will also cause bad influence and the companies should be more transparent on the usage of personal data. Third, some smart wearable companies take priority of multifunction of devices rather than data safety. Based on these problems, different entities should take on responsibilities. Users should improve their awareness and knowledge to protect their personal data. As for companies, some principles of personal data released by OECD can be applied when companies deal with personal information. When it comes to society, supervisions of the industry and support for advanced technology should be carried out.},

This new pervasive AR technology will lead to a continuous moderation of experienced reality with the potential to support better and faster decision-making, the exploration of new information, and novel ways of communication, interaction, and collaboration. However, pervasive AR technology will also have undesired consequences, e.g., in the areas of privacy, commercial exploitation, distractions, digital inequality, and our perception of what is true and real. Little is known about how severe these effects will be when AR has become pervasive and how they can be prevented or mitigated. We draw on current developments in research and the market, sketch a near-time future of pervasive AR technology, identify ethical considerations, and discuss the development of pervasive AR systems.},

	abstract = {Human beings value their privacy and the protection of their personalsphere of life. They value some control over who knows what aboutthem. They certainly do not want their personal information to beaccessible to just anyone at any time. But recent advances ininformation technology threaten privacy and have reduced the amount ofcontrol over personal data and open up the possibility of a range ofnegative consequences as a result of access to personal data. In thesecond half of the 20th century data protection regimeshave been put in place as a response to increasing levels ofprocessing of personal data. The 21st century has becomethe century of big data and advanced information technology (e.g.forms of deep learning), the rise of big tech companies and theplatform economy, which comes with the storage and processing ofexabytes of data., The revelations of Edward Snowden, and more recently the CambridgeAnalytica case (Cadwalladr \& Graham-Harrison 2018) havedemonstrated that worries about negative consequences are real. Thetechnical capabilities to collect, store and search large quantitiesof data concerning telephone conversations, internet searches andelectronic payment are now in place and are routinely used bygovernment agencies and corporate actors alike. The rise of China andthe large scale of use and spread of advanced digital technologies forsurveillance and control have only added to the concern of many. Forbusiness firms, personal data about customers and potential customersare now also a key asset. The scope and purpose of the personal datacentred business models of Big Tech (Google, Amazon, Facebook,Microsoft, Apple) has been described in detail by Shoshana Zuboff(2018) under the label “surveillance capitalism”. , At the same time, the meaning and value of privacy remains the subjectof considerable controversy. The combination of increasing power ofnew technology and the declining clarity and agreement on privacy giverise to problems concerning law, policy and ethics. Many of theseconceptual debates and issues are situated in the context ofinterpretation and analysis of the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) that was adopted by the EU in spring 2018 as the successor ofthe EU 1995 Directives, with application far beyond the borders of theEuropean Union., The focus of this article is on exploring the relationship betweeninformation technology and privacy. We will both illustrate thespecific threats that IT and innovations in IT pose for privacy andindicate how IT itself might be able to overcome theseprivacy concerns by being developed in ways that can be termed“privacy-sensitive”, “privacy enhancing” or “privacyrespecting”. We will also discuss the role of emerging technologiesin the debate, and account for the way in which moral debates arethemselves affected by IT.},

Wearables come in many different forms and flavors targeting different accessories and clothing that people wear. Although small in size, they are often expected to continuously sense, collect, and upload various physiological data to improve quality of life. These requirements put significant demand on improving communication security and reducing power consumption of the system, fueling new research in these areas. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive survey and classification of commercially available wearables and research prototypes. We then examine the communication security issues facing the popular wearables followed by a survey of solutions studied in the literature. We also categorize and explain the techniques for improving the power efficiency of wearables. Next, we survey the research literature in wearable computing. We conclude with future directions in wearable market and research.},
